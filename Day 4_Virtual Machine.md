## ✅ IaaS & Virtual Machines:-

## 1. What is IaaS?

IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. It's a cloud computing model where companies rent IT infrastructure—like servers, virtual machines, storage, and networks—from a cloud provider.

## 2. How do virtual machines fit into IaaS?

Virtual machines are the core part of IaaS. Instead of owning physical servers, users can create and run VMs on-demand via a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## 3. What are the benefits of using IaaS?

Scalability: You can scale resources up or down as needed.

Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use.

Flexibility: Run any OS or application.

No hardware maintenance.

## 4. What's the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

IaaS: You manage the OS and applications; provider manages infrastructure.

PaaS: Provider also manages OS and runtime (for developers).

SaaS: Everything is managed (like Gmail or Office 365).

## 5. Can you name some IaaS providers?

Yes—Amazon EC2 (AWS), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine, and IBM Cloud are popular IaaS providers.


## ✅ Modularization in Virtual Machines:-

## Q1: What is modularization in a virtual machine?

A: Modularization means dividing the VM setup into separate parts—like OS, applications, configurations—so each can be managed or updated independently.

## Q2: Why is modularization useful in VMs?

A: It makes the environment easier to maintain, reduces duplication, and helps with faster deployment. You can reuse base images and add features in layers.

## Q3: How can you configure modularization in VMs?

A: First, create a base VM with just the OS. Then, use tools like Ansible or shell scripts to add applications and services in layers. You can also use snapshots or templates for each layer.


## Q4: What tools help with this?

A: Ansible, Packer (to build modular VM images), and Vagrant (for managing VM environments) are commonly used.

## Q5: How does this help in DevOps or automation?

A: You can script and version-control each module. That makes testing and deployment faster and more consistent across environments.


## ✅ Service Account vs. Owner Account in Virtual Machines

## Q1: What is a service account in a virtual machine context?
A: A service account is a special type of account used by applications or services running on the VM to access other resources securely—without human interaction. It usually has limited permissions based on its role.

## Q2: What is an owner account?
A: An owner account is a user account with full administrative rights over the VM or cloud project. It can manage permissions, configure resources, delete VMs, and assign roles.

## Q3: What’s the difference between them?
A: The owner account is for human users with full control, while service accounts are for automated access by apps or scripts, usually with only the permissions they need (principle of least privilege).

## Q4: Why use a service account instead of just the owner account?
A: For security and automation. Using service accounts avoids sharing admin credentials with scripts, and limits the damage if something goes wrong.

## Q5: How are service accounts configured in VMs?
A: When launching a VM—like on Google Cloud or AWS—you can attach a service account and assign specific roles. The VM can then access cloud APIs using that identity.

## ✅ GKE, Containers, Services & Repo:-

## Q1: What are containers?
A: Containers are lightweight, portable environments that package applications with all their dependencies, making them run consistently across systems. Docker is the most common container tool.

## Q2: What is GKE?
A: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes platform that allows you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications automatically.

## Q3: How do containers run in GKE?
A: In GKE, containers are grouped into pods. Kubernetes schedules these pods to run on nodes (virtual machines), and GKE manages the underlying infrastructure.

## Q4: What is a GKE Service?
A: A GKE Service is a Kubernetes object that exposes a set of pods as a network service—allowing other apps, internal or external, to communicate with it.

## Q5: What is a repo, and how is it used with GKE?
A: A repo (repository) stores container images (e.g., in Google Container Registry or Artifact Registry). You build your Docker image, push it to the repo, and GKE pulls it to deploy.
