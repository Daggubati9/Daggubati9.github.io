## ✅ IaaS & Virtual Machines:-

## 1. What is IaaS?

IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. It's a cloud computing model where companies rent IT infrastructure—like servers, virtual machines, storage, and networks—from a cloud provider.

## 2. How do virtual machines fit into IaaS?

Virtual machines are the core part of IaaS. Instead of owning physical servers, users can create and run VMs on-demand via a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## 3. What are the benefits of using IaaS?

Scalability: You can scale resources up or down as needed.

Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use.

Flexibility: Run any OS or application.

No hardware maintenance.

## 4. What's the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

IaaS: You manage the OS and applications; provider manages infrastructure.

PaaS: Provider also manages OS and runtime (for developers).

SaaS: Everything is managed (like Gmail or Office 365).

## 5. Can you name some IaaS providers?

Yes—Amazon EC2 (AWS), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine, and IBM Cloud are popular IaaS providers.

## ✅ Modularization in Virtual Machines:-

## Q1: What is modularization in a virtual machine?

A: Modularization means dividing the VM setup into separate parts—like OS, applications, configurations—so each can be managed or updated independently.

## Q2: Why is modularization useful in VMs?

A: It makes the environment easier to maintain, reduces duplication, and helps with faster deployment. You can reuse base images and add features in layers.

## Q3: How can you configure modularization in VMs?

A: First, create a base VM with just the OS. Then, use tools like Ansible or shell scripts to add applications and services in layers. You can also use snapshots or templates for each layer.


## Q4: What tools help with this?

A: Ansible, Packer (to build modular VM images), and Vagrant (for managing VM environments) are commonly used.

## Q5: How does this help in DevOps or automation?

A: You can script and version-control each module. That makes testing and deployment faster and more consistent across environments.
