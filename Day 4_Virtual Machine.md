## ✅ IaaS & Virtual Machines:-

## 1. What is IaaS?

IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. It's a cloud computing model where companies rent IT infrastructure—like servers, virtual machines, storage, and networks—from a cloud provider.

## 2. How do virtual machines fit into IaaS?

Virtual machines are the core part of IaaS. Instead of owning physical servers, users can create and run VMs on-demand via a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## 3. What are the benefits of using IaaS?

Scalability: You can scale resources up or down as needed.

Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use.

Flexibility: Run any OS or application.

No hardware maintenance.

## 4. What's the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

IaaS: You manage the OS and applications; provider manages infrastructure.

PaaS: Provider also manages OS and runtime (for developers).

SaaS: Everything is managed (like Gmail or Office 365).

## 5. Can you name some IaaS providers?

Yes—Amazon EC2 (AWS), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine, and IBM Cloud are popular IaaS providers.
