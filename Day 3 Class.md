## ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Overview:-

## üîπ GCP (Google Cloud Platform):
A cloud service by Google that lets you run applications, store data, and use powerful computing resources online.

## üîπ Google Cloud Platform:
Same as GCP ‚Äî it includes tools for computing, databases, AI, and storage, all accessible through the internet.

## üîπ Project:
A project in GCP is a logical container for resources (like APIs, storage, databases).

All billing, access control, and API usage are tied to a specific project.

## üîπ Terraform:
An open-source tool used to automatically create and manage cloud resources (like GCP projects) using simple code.

## üîê Access Control in GCP

üîπ IAM (Identity and Access Management)

Manages who can do what on which resources. Access controls who can view, use, or manage resources in a Google Cloud project. It‚Äôs managed through IAM permissions.


## Roles:
## üîπ Primitive Role:
Basic roles like Viewer, Editor, and Owner that apply broad access across all resources in a project.

## üîπ Predefined Role:
Roles created by Google with specific permissions for a particular service (e.g., Storage Admin, Compute Viewer). Granular, service-specific roles (e.g., BigQuery Data Viewer, Dialogflow Admin).

## üîπ Custom Role:
User-created roles that allow you to define a set of permissions tailored to your specific needs. You define specific permissions for custom needs.


## üîë Service Account:
A special Google account used by apps or virtual machines (VMs) to access GCP services.

Helps run services like Cloud Run or authenticate with APIs like Dialogflow.

## üìä API Services and Usage:
    Billing Based on Usage:GCP charges based on actual usage (e.g., number of queries, storage used, compute time).       
    Billing Account:Your project must be linked to a Billing Account to use paid GCP services.

## API / Service	Purpose:
| **API Name**       | **Simple Explanation**                                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dialogflow API** | Used to build chatbots and voice assistants that understand human language. |
| **Cloud SQL API**  | Lets you manage cloud databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.                  |
| **BigQuery API**   | Helps you run fast queries on huge amounts of data.                         |
| **Vertex AI API**  | Used to build and run machine learning models easily.                       |
| **Cloud Run API**  | Runs your container apps and handles scaling automatically.                 |
| **Connectors API** | Connects GCP with other systems like Salesforce or databases.               |


## üîπ Virtual Networking:
Virtual networking in cloud platforms like GCP allows resources (like VMs) to communicate securely using virtual networks.
It includes components like VPCs, subnets, firewalls, and IP addresses to manage traffic flow.

## CHAT GPT Versions:
GPT-4.5 is the latest version of ChatGPT, released by OpenAI on February 27, 2025 .
Older versions like GPT-3.5 and GPT-3 were slower and less advanced in understanding and answering questions.

## VPC:
üîπ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like your own private network inside the cloud.

üîπ It helps connect and protect your cloud resources like virtual machines, databases, etc.

üîπ You can control:

üîπ Think of it as setting up your own mini data center, but online.

## Firewall:
üîπ A firewall is a security system that controls who can access your network and what traffic is allowed in and out.

üîπ It works like a gatekeeper:

It blocks unwanted traffic (like hackers trying to get in).

It allows trusted traffic (like your web browser accessing a website).

üîπ You can set rules to decide which types of data are safe or unsafe.

## GCP Storage options:
| **Storage Type**     | **Description**                                                                              | **Types of Files Stored**                                                                                                 |
