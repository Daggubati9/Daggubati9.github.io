Type of Random Variables: Discret and continuous
Type of Functions: Probability Mass funtion, Cumilative Distribution function and Density
Variable
A variable is a symbol (like x or y) used to represent a value that can change.

ðŸ”¹ Random Variable
A random variable is a variable whose value is the outcome of a random process.

Example: Let X be the number of heads when flipping 2 coins.

ðŸ”¹ Experiment
An experiment in probability is a process or action that leads to a result.

Example: Tossing a coin, rolling a die.

ðŸ”¹ Random Experiment
An experiment where the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.

Example: Rolling a die â€” you donâ€™t know which number youâ€™ll get.

ðŸ”¹ Outcome
An outcome is a single possible result of an experiment.

Example: Getting a 5 when rolling a die.

ðŸ”¹ Basic Outcome
Same as an elementary outcome â€” a single result in the sample space.

Example: Getting tails in one coin flip.

ðŸ”¹ Sample Outcome / Sample Space
Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

Example: For a coin flip â†’ S = {Heads, Tails}

ðŸ”¹ Discrete Random Variable
Takes on countable values (usually whole numbers).

Example: Number of heads in 3 coin tosses â†’ 0, 1, 2, 3.

ðŸ”¹ Continuous Random Variable
Takes on infinite values in a range (like real numbers).

Example: Height, time, weight.

ðŸ”¹ Events
An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.

Example: Rolling an even number â†’ {2, 4, 6}

ðŸ”¹ Function / f(x)
A function assigns each input (x) to a specific output.

In probability: often refers to the Probability Function.

ðŸ”¹ Probability Mass Function (PMF)
Used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability of each possible value.

Notation: P(X = x)

Example: P(X = 2) = 0.3

ðŸ”¹ Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
Gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a value.

Notation: F(x) = P(X â‰¤ x)

Used for both discrete and continuous variables.

ðŸ”¹ Probability Density Function (PDF)
Used for continuous random variables.

Describes the likelihood of the variable falling within a range, not a specific point.

Notation: f(x)

ðŸ”¹ Set
A collection of well-defined elements.

Example: A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Union (A âˆª B): All elements in A or B (or both)

Intersection (A âˆ© B): Elements in both A and B

Difference (A âˆ’ B): Elements in A but not in B

Complement (Aâ€²): All elements in the universal set not in A
