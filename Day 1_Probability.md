## 1.ðŸ”¹Variable
A variable is a symbol (like x or y) used to represent a value that can change.

## 2.ðŸ”¹ Random Variable
A random variable is a variable whose value is the outcome of a random process.

Example: Let X be the number of heads when flipping 2 coins.

## 3.ðŸ”¹ Experiment
An experiment in probability is a process or action that leads to a result.

Example: Tossing a coin, rolling a die.

## 4.ðŸ”¹ Random Experiment
An experiment where the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.

Example: Rolling a die â€” you donâ€™t know which number youâ€™ll get.

## 5.ðŸ”¹ Outcome
An outcome is a single possible result of an experiment.

Example: Getting a 5 when rolling a die.

## 6.ðŸ”¹ Basic Outcome
Same as an elementary outcome â€” a single result in the sample space.

Example: Getting tails in one coin flip.

## 7.ðŸ”¹ Sample Outcome / Sample Space
Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

Example: For a coin flip â†’ S = {Heads, Tails}

## 8.ðŸ”¹Type of Random Variables:-
## ðŸ”¹Discrete Random Variable
Takes on countable values (usually whole numbers).

Example: Number of heads in 3 coin tosses â†’ 0, 1, 2, 3.

## ðŸ”¹Continuous Random Variable
Takes on infinite values in a range (like real numbers).

Example: Height, time, weight.

## 9.ðŸ”¹Events
An event is one or more outcomes of an experiment.

Example: Rolling an even number â†’ {2, 4, 6}

## 10.ðŸ”¹Function / f(x)
A function assigns each input (x) to a specific output.

In probability: often refers to the Probability Function.

## 11.Type of Functions:-
ðŸ”¹ Probability Mass Function (PMF)
Used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability of each possible value.

Notation: P(X = x)

Example: P(X = 2) = 0.3

ðŸ”¹ Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
Gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a value.

Notation: F(x) = P(X â‰¤ x)

Used for both discrete and continuous variables.

ðŸ”¹ Probability Density Function (PDF)
Used for continuous random variables.

Describes the likelihood of the variable falling within a range, not a specific point.

Notation: f(x)

## 12ðŸ”¹ Set Theory
A collection of well-defined elements.

ðŸ”¹Example: A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Union (A âˆª B): All elements in A or B (or both)

Intersection (A âˆ© B): Elements in both A and B

Difference (A âˆ’ B): Elements in A but not in B

Complement (Aâ€²): All elements in the universal set not in A

ðŸ”¹Example:
The manager of a factory claims that among his 400 employees.

312 got a pay rise last year

248 got increased pension benefits last year

173 got both pension benefits and pay rise last year

13 got neither

calculate the probability of.
a)Getting a pay rise

b)Not getting a pay rise 

c)Getting both a pay rise and pension benefits 

d)Getting no pay rise or benefit increase 

e)Getting a pay rise or benefits 

Answer is:
Total employees = 400

A: Employees who got a pay rise = 312

B: Employees who got pension benefits = 248

Aâˆ©B: Employees who got both = 173

Neither = 13

a)Getting a pay rise:
P(PayÂ Rise)= 312/400=0.78

b)Not getting a pay rise:
P(NoÂ PayÂ Rise)=1âˆ’P(PayÂ Rise)=1âˆ’0.78=0.22

c)Getting both a pay rise and pension benefits
P(PayÂ RiseÂ andÂ Benefits)= 173/400-0.4325

d)Getting no pay rise or benefit increase:
P(Neither)= 13/400-0.0325

e)Getting a pay rise or benefits:
P(AâˆªB)=P(A)+P(B)âˆ’P(Aâˆ©B)
312+248-173/400= 387/400= 0.9675
